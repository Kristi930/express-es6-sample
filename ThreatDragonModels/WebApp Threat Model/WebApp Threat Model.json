    "description": "A three-tier web application for managing users and records. End-users access the User Interface (Browser) over HTTPS, which sends requests to the Web Application (API server). The API performs authentication/authorization, input validation, and business logic, and then queries the Database over a private network. Primary assets include user identities, session tokens, and PII stored at rest. Trust boundaries exist between Browser↔API (internet) and API↔DB (internal network). The model assumes TLS is enforced, secrets are stored in a vault, and least-privilege roles are applied. Out of scope: third-party identity providers’ internal risks.",
